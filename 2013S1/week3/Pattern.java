public class Pattern {
	// immutable!
	private final String pattern;

	// We define a static factory method to construct a pattern from a string.
	// This helps readability, but there's a stronger reason to do it. It's
	// virtually always a great idea to only provide static factory methods for
	// immutable classes (and hide your constructors). I'll explain more in
	// detail later on in the semester, but the short story is that static
	// factory methods don't *have* to return a new object (= more memory
	// usage), whereas constructors do. So, if we pass the same string into
	// this method twice, we have the liberty of only creating one object and
	// returning it both times (which is fine, because it's immutable).
	public static Pattern fromString(String pattern) {
		// In this implementation, we're just delegating to the
		// constructor anyway, so nothing is effectively different.
		// We'll still be allocating new memory every time fromString is
		// called. However, the important point is that it can be changed
		// later. We can change our implementation of how our Patterns are
		// created and client code won't break; clients won't even know!
		if (isValid(pattern)) {
			return new Pattern(pattern);
		} else {
			return null;
		}
	}
	// see the bottom of the class for example code

	// Our constructor is private so clients must call the factory method
	private Pattern(String pattern) {
		this.pattern = pattern;
	}

	// We also define a static validator method to make life much easier for
	// clients of this class. Note: we don't have to call this "isValidString",
	// thanks to Java's overriding ability. We can easily define another method
	// later on with the type "public static boolean isValid(Doohicky x)" to
	// validate Doohickies, and it would coexist happily with this.
	public static boolean isValid(String pattern) {
		// This method is far and away the hardest to implement. I would
		// probably approach it by defining a "T9Keyboard" class to work out
		// e.g. what's "up" from 5, and go from there.
	}

	// We define the standard equals method so that, e.g., the safe can
	// determine equality of two patterns to work out if a given pattern
	// is valid.
	public boolean equals(Pattern other) {
		// We define Pattern equality in terms of the equality of the
		// underlying strings; clients don't know that, though (unless
		// we document it, which might be a bad idea).
		// We might decide tomorrow to store the patterns as a matrix
		// and clients would be none the wiser.
		return pattern.equals(other.pattern);
		// We can access other's private pattern field because
		// it's the same class as us.
	}
	// we could call our method to determine equality "equalTo" but the
	// "equals" method is standard in Java and is defined by Object (Pattern's
	// superclass), so always call your equality methods "equals".

	/* Example code:

	String patternCode = "3DDLU";
	if (Pattern.isValid(patternCode)) {
		Pattern p = Pattern.fromString(patternCode);
		if (p.equals(this.pattern)) {
			unlock();
		}
	}
