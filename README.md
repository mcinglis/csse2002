# CSSE2002 Solutions

[CSSE2002](http://www.uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=CSSE2002) is a course taught at [UQ](https://uq.edu.au). It teaches Java programming, object-oriented abstraction, introductory testing, etc. It's required for most software-ish degrees at UQ.

During semester, I'll regularly update my website with resources for the course: http://minglis.id.au/csse2002
