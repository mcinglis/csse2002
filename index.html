          <h1>Week 3</h1>

          <div class=update>
            <p>Oops! I made two important mistakes in this code somewhere. I'll mention the corrections as exercises in my classes next week.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Here are my revised <a href="https://github.com/zenmunki/csse2002/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week3">practical solutions</a>. I re-implemented the <code>ThreeWayLamp</code> class to use enums (mentioned in class), and extended it to have colors to communicate the benefit of enums. I've put in a link to a tutorial on enum types.</p>
            <p>You can also see my approaches to the <a href="https://github.com/zenmunki/csse2002/blob/gh-pages/solutions/week3/Flight.java">flight</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zenmunki/csse2002/blob/gh-pages/solutions/week3/Pattern.java">unlock pattern</a> design problems from my tutorials. As mentioned at the top of <code>Flight.java</code>, you should definitely not write your comments like I have in these files. Also, as always, post a question on the newsgroup or email me if you have questions.</p>
          </div>

          <p>This week's tutorials went really well. It was great to see the different groups concurrently working on such diverse problems. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/minglis.id.au/presentation/d/1VSxTKLhllYiJujUwtjluumhpVKAB0GkDEdXU5Myrzww/present#slide=id.gb2a008c0_036">Here are the slides</a>. I reviewed the answers, and it seems many students aren't yet comfortable writing and thinking in Java. We'll get plenty more opportunities to practise this throughout the semester, but you should also devote some spare time to practising it too. It's certainly a skill you'll have to acquire to do well in this course.</p>

          <p>See you next week!</p>

          <h1>Week 2</h1>

          <div class=update>
            <p>My solutions to this week's tutorial questions, and to (some of) my prac challenges, are now available <a href="https://github.com/zenmunki/csse2002/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week2">here</a>. Please note that my solutions aren't authoritative about the course; don't take any of this code to be representative of the content of CSSE2002 in any way. That said, you're more than welcome to contact me if you have questions about this code. Cheers!</p>

            <p>The extra problems I gave were taken from the book <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=cracking+the+coding+interview">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> by Gayle McDowell. You can see the book's given solutions to these problems (and find more problems) <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ctci/source/browse/">here</a> -- they're all from Chapter 1. I don't think the book's solutions are very good: for example, the book's solutions for the problems I gave won't work for unicode characters. However, reading bad code, and understanding why it's bad, is a great way to learn.</p>
          </div>

          <p>I ran out of time in both tutorials this week. Sorry about that; I'll try to time things better next week.</p>

          <p>I didn't really get to cover static methods or access modifiers. See these links below to read up on those topics and others.</p>

          <p>He's some more practice methods to implement (try to do them on paper first!):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>boolean isUniqueChars(String string)</code> that returns true if the string contains only unique characters, and false otherwise</li>
            <li><code>void removeDuplicates(char[] chars)</code> that removes all duplicate characters in <code>chars</code>, but retains their ordering</li>
            <li><code>boolean areAnagrams(String s1, String s2)</code> that returns true if the strings are anagrams of one another, and false otherwise</li>
          </ul>
